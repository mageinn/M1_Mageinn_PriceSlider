# AJAX Price Slider with Multiselect for Magento® 1

## Description
Mageinn Ajax Price Slider with Multiselect is a module for Magento which allows users to filter products by a certain price range as per their choice. The module uses noUiSlider which is a range slider without bloat. It offers a ton of features, and it is as small, lightweight and minimal as possible, which is great for mobile use on the many supported devices, including iPhone, iPad, Android devices & Windows (Phone) 8 desktops, tablets, and all-in-ones. It works on desktops too, of course!

The module allows you use a slider instead of a list of ranges to select price range which appears in the layer navigation. Multiselect allows users select multiple attribute options to filter results. Also, the module can use AJAX calls to filter results without page reload. This extension will improve layered navigation usability for your customers.
